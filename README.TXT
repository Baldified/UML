Programming LIA – Vending Machine Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a functional vending machine simulator created for the
Programming LIA assignment. The program allows users to view available
items, select products, purchase them, and track stock as it decreases.
The machine offers 8 different items, each starting with a stock of 10.
Once an item runs out, it can no longer be purchased.
